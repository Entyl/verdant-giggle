# Chat Server
The Chat Server was another interesting and challenging program I wrote for a class because I had never had to use sockets nor programmed using cryptography, before.  &nbsp;Like the name of the project describes, this project was a chat service that encrypted messages so only people in the chat room could read them.  &nbsp;To compile the server and client type "javac SecureChatServer.java" and "javac SecureChatClient.java" respectively.  &nbsp;To use the server and clients, first run the server with "java SecureChatServer".  &nbsp;Then you can run several clients by typing "java SecureChatClient" in separate command prompts.  &nbsp;Use "localhost" as the server if you are just running on your own machine. &nbsp;Disclaimer: SecureChatServer.java, SymCipher.java, and keys.txt were provided.
